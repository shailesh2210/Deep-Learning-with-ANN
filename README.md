# Deep Learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Projects 
Welcome to the Deep Learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Projects README! This document provides a guide for creating deep learning projects based on artificial neural networks.

## 1. Project
### Gold Price Prediction :
- The Gold Price Prediction ANN project aims to develop a machine learning model based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to forecast the future prices of gold. The goal of this project is to leverage historical gold price data and ANN techniques to build a predictive model that can provide insights into future price trends.

## 2. Project 
### Diabets Prediction
- The goal of diabetes prediction using artificial neural networks (ANN) is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes. ANN is a computational model inspired by the function of biological neural networks in the human brain.
